## Reading: *Making things: Photobashing as Archaeological Remediation? by Tara Copplestone*: 
- Photobashing: – a technique by which one takes photos and applies various techniques such as painting, filtering, overlaying and otherwise obliterating the original photo through manipulation.
- Photobashing, due to sitting at an intersection of subjective processes and mechanical capture, allows for some interesting interactions and reflexivity between both sides of this discussion – whilst bashing away you think about how and why the photos were taken in particular ways, how your processes alter or engage with this and how the various remediation’s both affect and effect that relationship.
- Photobashing is a technique which (to my knowledge) has not found a huge amount of use in the archaeological processes. Despite this it provides a space where an interesting interplay between the subjective, mechanical and data driven capture elements of archaeological work-flow can be explored in a way which layers and potentially inverts the usual relationship.

## Reading: *Generonimos by Kate Compton*:
- The Generominos are a physical instantiation of a new framework by Kate Compton for thinking about generative interactive art and games. Generative methods often involve taking one kind of data and transforming it into another.
- The Generominos cards are a constructive model of how pipelines transform the datastreams generated from inputs into the type of data needed by the outputs, though a series of compatible transformations. Like Dominos, each card has some sockets, only in this case, we can have several sockets for input (on the top), and several for output (on the bottom). Some cards may not have input sockets, others may not have output sockets.

## Reading: *The Casual Creator by Kate Compton*:
- In this dissertation, I’m defining a new genre of software, the “Knit Magic” of software, in which creativity is both restricted and supported to allow greater accessibility, ease of use, and, perhaps, greater creativity because of that.
- it’s particularly useful when looking at these casual creator systems, whether a Rainbow Loom or the Spore Creature Creator, because it walks so easily around the tangential issues of age and audience and gender that get bound up with traditional marketing genres, which construct commercially-useful groupings of target consumers, rather than intellectually-productive groupings of software.
- Casual creator definition: 
an authored system or software that:
1. privileges enjoyment of the creative process above productivity
2. encourages and supports a state of creative flow
3. results in the user’s feeling of pride and ownership toward the produced artifact, and sense of pride in their own creativity.
- Why hasn’t anyone identified this field yet?
Partly, audience.  Though there are exceptions, this field has traditionally been sold as a young, or female, which is a recipe for not being taken seriously by either academics or software engineers.
- A definition of creativity (centered on production): Creativity is any act, idea, or product that changes an existing domain, or that transforms an existing domain into a new one.
- To cite wallpaper designer, socialist and futurist, William Morris, we are creative so that “our days will be happy and eventful.” We can scientifically demonstrate that people who do art therapy are happier, healthier, more at ease, less in pain, and more social after having a creative experience.  The existence of pottery-painting and paint-by-numbers kits shows proof that people enjoy being creative, even if the world won’t be noticeably changed by their output. It also turns out that restrictions, constraints, and support structures and guided assistance don’t fundamentally undermine the creative process, but often enhance it.
- **Patterns in Casual Creator products/software**:
1. Never Start With A Blank Page.

## Reading: *Twine, Inform, and Designing Interactive History Texts By Jeremiah McCall*:
- having students research and design historical simulation games is an outstanding high order thinking assignment that exercises many critical skills of the historian, especially:
1. The ability to research, evaluate, and analyze evidence about the past
2. The ability to combine pieces of evidence into a plausible interpretation of the past
3. The ability to discriminate between the critical and trivial parts of a historical event or process
4. The ability to use these skills to develop defensible, coherent, and meaningful interpretations of the past.

- Inform is an amazing tool. It really is; its relative accessibility and ease of use combined with its power and sophistication is amazing. As helpful and relatively easy to learn as it is, developing anything beyond the simplest interactions with objects and NPCs tends to require devoting time to coding beyond what most history teachers can reasonably afford in their classes.
- Twine: Twine, however, is essentially a tool that enables players to create linked hypertexts easily that publish to a single html, css, and JavaScript page, a single web page in other words. The player reads a passage of text, selects how to respond to the passage by clicking on the available hyperlinks and then is delivered a new passage of text.
- The basics of a Twine game are passages with links to passages. Passages are entered into the Twine Editor as straight text and links use a simple syntax in Twine 2 Harlowe:
[[Text of Link Player Sees->Name of passage link goes to]]
- Twine offers interactive text designers a great deal of power and functionality beyond this basic passage/link combo: variables can be created to store, track, and display information, conditional statements allow variety in the text displayed and the passages visited, and thus variety in players’ journeys and outcomes, and there are many ways to format and link text to create a variety of effects. 

## Video: Can a Computer be Creative?: 
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECVx8ENvgV8>

- Computers are good at mechanical tasks, but what about "creativity"/input from the actual computer?
- Can computers add something they're not programmed to add specifically? How can it do these creative things? 
- AI and creativity: how can creativity be modelled or simulated? 
Various types of computational creativity (some examples):
1. Language
2. Music and sound
3. Science
4. Art and Visual
5. Lifestyle

Different systems work in different ways: bunch of rules programmed, told here are the rules (some can be broken). Or maybe it's programmed to mimic the brain. 

WHY DO THIS? Get computers to do creative things, but also to understand human creativity.
How do we judge creativity? It is quite subjective. 
What does it mean to be creative: word association (ideas, imaginative, produce, create, ability, originality, new). You should know a word by the company it keeps. 
Whole other corpus on creativity and do distant reading: 14 different areas of creativity (intention and emotional involvement) (Independence and freedom) (Progression and development)(domain competence) etc. different areas/programs put different weight on certain categories. ie: results over originality and vice versa. ie: music improvisation isn't always what "sounds" "best". Process versus result. 

**Can computers really be creative?** 
- They already are! We just have to *accept* the creativity of computers. It is a fast burgeoning field. 
### Definition:

- A definition of creativity (centered on production): Creativity is any act, idea, or product that changes an existing domain, or that transforms an existing domain into a new one.


### Issues/Debates:
- How do we define creativity? Should a computer/program act as an aid/guide for creativity, or can it be creative/should it be creative on its own? Is that true creativity? How do we program creativity/spontaneity?
- Should we priviledge emotional involvement/flow?
- How important is the intent behind the results?
- How can we give a system intent/Emotional involvement?

### Tools/Exercises?:

- Maybe print of some Generonimos and try and apply it to a game? *<http://www.galaxykate.com/generominos/generominos.pdf>* Print some off and go through the scenarios maybe? See how to use these cards to understand HOW computers work better/how input/output is played out.
