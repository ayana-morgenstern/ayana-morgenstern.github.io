# Social Media

## *Reading: "10 ways to get started fighting internet propaganda" by Kris Shaffer*:
- Internet propaganda is such a big problem that it can't go un-addressed. But it's such a big problem that it can be overwhelming to know how to resist it.
- I define propaganda as the use of one or more media to communicate a message, with the aim of changing someone's mind or actions via psychological manipulation, rather than reasoned discourse.
**- Disinformation vs misinformation: Disinformation (from the Russian dezinformatsiya) is an information operation that deliberately attempts to deceive. Misinformation, on the other hand, is an inadvertent sharing of false or misleading information.
**_How to resist_**:
1. Fact check
Check for previous fact-checking work
Go upstream to the source
Read laterally
2. Don't share
3. Follow the right people
4. Be skeptical of the right things
5. Don't duplicate work
6. Learn a few good APIs (application programming interfaces)
7. Get comfortable with web scraping
8. Compare multiple networks
9. Don't dox
10. Join D4D (Data for Democracy)

## *Reading: "BREAKING UP WITH FACEBOOK: UNTETHERING FROM THE IDEOLOGICAL FREIGHT OF ONLINE SURVEILLANCE" by Estee Beck*:
- the addition of Facebook’s GraphSearch — a super search engine based on phrases — affirmed how much data the social media company had about users, and established Facebook’s willingness to share such data with just about whomever wanted access. 
- Tracking technologies mine our browsers for data; computer algorithms take the data, run calculations, and output personalized information for the user.
- Ultimately, the discussion of a refracted online experience addresses a larger conversation about the persuasive abilities of computer algorithms and code. 
- With personalized advertisements and recommendations, we might turn to ask, what are we not seeing? How are we being categorized? Might this be a form of discriminatory practice?
- We can no longer afford to sit passively by while surveillance technologies harvest our data because there is too much at stake.

## *Reading: "Wikipedia Doesn’t Realize It's the Developing World’s Internet Gatekeeper" by Jason Koebler*:
- Angolans are using free access to Wikipedia and Facebook to trade copyrighted movies, music, and television shows, a development that is decidedly against Wikipedia's rules. The product is called Wikipedia Zero, which "zero rates" all data going to and from Wikipedia websites from mobile phone users in 64 developing countries, meaning the customer doesn't pay any money for it.
- Wikipedia and Facebook have now become the internet for many Angolans and that it is now a gatekeeper for how they access it.
- there are no good solutions outside of lowering the cost and expanding the availability of real, generic internet access for people in the developing world. 
- What Wikimedia is faced with are two bad options—censor and monitor the internet or allow Angolans to break Wikipedia's rules and maybe the law—that underscore the fundamental problems with zero rating programs that may have been started with the best of intentions.

# Social Media

## Twitter in particular

What is social media? 
- A platform that encourages community/creating and sharing content. Interaction/interactivity. Social interactions/communication (sometimes based on values/interests). Sometimes about connecting to strangers or people you know. 
- Identity construction. 
- Validation. 
- Entertainment
- Bots
- social responsibility of these platforms. 

## Twitter as tool for democracy?
- Can it facilitate change? --> what does change mean? Societal/structural change vs change in daily habits (micro). 
- What role does accessibility play?
- does it actually help counteract existing societal barriers?
**Consider blacklivesmatter movement**
- Reduces hierarchies or reproduces and sustains them?
- Social capital vs. Social Cohesion

**not just humans that have agency: bots and how they can manipulate appearances of "noise"** Make something seem popular when in reality it is manipulation: gets humans to engage and then it becomes a story about engagement: something that wasn't real becomes real/validated by human interaction. 

**providing knowledge vs providing data** 

**understanding vs awareness** 

- twitter essay/twitter conference : these different formats allow for different levels of engagement. 

**gamergate** weaponization of the internet. attacking the norms of what is truth. "if you share a lie loud enough, people will stop believing in the things that are true". **importance of fact-checking/media literacy** 

*these platforms often attract like-minded to like-minded* now requires effort to find opposing mindsets. or we are searching for it to disagree with it: the intent is not to debate and become more open-minded.  

- can facilite networks/networking that you could not usually encounter **can also exacerbate existing bias** 
- selling privacy for convenience and interactivity. 
- creating digital copies of ourselves: simulacra!
- do companies have social responsibility as to how their platforms are used? Difference between legal responsibility/social responsibility. 
- Troll: clear intent. often about disagreement. "shit-disturbing". 
- Bot: Intent is ambiguous. automated.
- General public: the masses. the average layperson.
