## Command Line Tutorial
- Working on the command line. Going well. Finding it hard to decipher what everything means and tend to get confused as to the difference between "shell" and "directory". 
- When navigating through files, important to remember to use cd -- to start over if you get lost, and to think of files as "trees"
- you can basically do anything on your computer without leaving the command line! **Neat!**
- you can also use the arrows to move through the "history" of your commands.

**Using VIM (txt editor)**:

Ctrl+F (that is, holding down your ‘control key’ and pressing the letter F) will move you down a page

Ctrl+B will move you up a page.

If you want to rapidly move to the end of a line, you can press: $ and to move to the start of one, 0. You can also move between sentences by typing ) (forward) or ( (backwards). For paragraphs, use } and {. Since you are doing everything with your keyboard, rather than having to hold your arrow key down to move around a document, this lets you zip quickly back and forth.

**Other commands**:
cp is copy. mv is move.
The ./ command refers to the current directory you’re in. This is a really valuable command. *helps you find your place!*
 Some of our other favourites are du, which is a way to find out how much memory is being used (du -h makes it human readable — as with other commands). For those of you on OS X, top provides an overview of what processes are running and touch FILENAME can create a basic text file 
 cat *	cat is a versatile command. It will read a file to you if you substitute a file for * , but can also be used to combine files.

## Markdown Tutorial
- Stackedit is a useful place to practice doing MD. I'm already pretty good at it tho. 
-  Since Markdown does not distinguish between fonts, we represent code by wrapping snippets in back-tick characters like "`"` For example, `<br />`. 
- Images can be referenced using !, followed by some alt-text in square brackets, followed by the image URL and an optional title. These will not be displayed in your plain text document, but would be embedded into a rendered HTML page.
Inserting images:

Tables/that kinda thing:

| Heading 1 | Heading 2 | Heading 3 |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Row 1, column 1 | Row 1, column 2 | Row 1, column 3|
| Row 2, column 1 | Row 2, column 2 | Row 2, column 3|
| Row 3, column 1 | Row 3, column 2 | Row 3, column 3|


## Pandoc Tutorial

- Installing Pandoc itself proves to be a damn nightmare. Finalement, I manage it!
- OMG MY TEXT EDIT WASNT NATURALLY IN PLAIN TEXT SO THAT SET ME BACK. Ok this is a nightmare, nothing is working. 
I'm going to try and come back to this. [PandocMarkdownTips/Tutorial](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown)

## Version Control Tutorial:
- Ok this makes sense to me: I already essentially do this on github with a lot of my own notes.
- I hate all of this. My head hurts a lot.
- So far can't figure out if github desktop is supposed to allow me to do local changes, as I am only managing the remote ones and then pushing them to desktop. *sigh*

Ok finally managed to get the blog up and running but still not able to get the whole pandoc stuff figured out. Going to stick with what I know for now. 

# Reading: Poetic Terrorism and Art Sabotage

**Poetic Terrorism:**
- So basically do performance art/deviant acts of resistance. 
Public art created for poetic terrorism/*resistance*. 
The reaction must be strong/akin to terror: intense arousal, disgust, surprise. 
- Don’t do PT for other artists, do it for people who will not realize (at least for a few moments) that what you have done is art. Avoid recognizable art- categories, avoid politics, don’t stick around to argue, don’t be sentimental; be ruthless, take risks, vandalize only what must be defaced, do something children will remember all their lives — but don’t be spontaneous unless the PT Muse has possessed you.
Dress up. Leave a false name. Be legendary. The best PT is against the law, but don’t get caught. Art as crime; crime as art.

**Art Sabotage:**
- Art sabotage strives to be perfectly exemplary but at the same time retain an element of opacity — not propaganda but aesthetic shock — apallingly direct yet also subtly angled — action-as-metaphor.
Art Sabotage is the dark side of Poetic Terrorism.
- Galleries turn beauty into a commodity but banks transmute Imagination into feces and debt. Wouldn’t the world gain a degree of beauty with each bank that could be made to trem- ble. . . or fall? But how? Art Sabotage should probably stay away from politics (it’s so boring) — but not from banks.


**Idea of inaction/destruction as creation** Idea of ephemerality. Idea that "public" history can be personal: affect one person at a time. Is this useful?

*Aesthetic Shock*

## Class: 

ARIS: Location based games and stories. 

Ottawa's public history is official/governmental. Think about the power differential? Still operating on a broadcast model. 
ie: idea of renting/giving away land for greenbelt. Confronting people with an idea of their neighbourhood that is different. Projecting cascades of words/text onto a building: explode the narrative. 
Idea of projecting genres of music/events/band names onto these "underground" music scenes. 
Projecting a history of artist interventions?
*Idea of anonymity* What affordances does this bring?
- Projection mapping of MMIW
- Idea of truth decay: use as much gravitas possible to intervene in truth decay?

- Urban church involved in 60s scoop!!!!!! 
- I like the idea of pushing boundaries and engaging in confrontation: make people uncomfortable. Figure out different affordances. 
- **PLAY WITH THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE NORTHERN LIGHTS TEXT** Explode the text, rewrite it. 

We're gonna build something in Aris! [Aris](https://fielddaylab.org/make/aris/)

- You could do a neighbourhood tour?
- Plaques are way points in the story. I WANNA BUILD A STORY FOR SURE!

- Tool to plan out what should happen: Twinery.
