## Command Line Tutorial
- Working on the command line. Going well. Finding it hard to decipher what everything means and tend to get confused as to the difference between "shell" and "directory". 
- When navigating through files, important to remember to use cd -- to start over if you get lost, and to think of files as "trees"
- you can basically do anything on your computer without leaving the command line! **Neat!**
- you can also use the arrows to move through the "history" of your commands.

**Using VIM (txt editor)**:

Ctrl+F (that is, holding down your ‘control key’ and pressing the letter F) will move you down a page

Ctrl+B will move you up a page.

If you want to rapidly move to the end of a line, you can press: $ and to move to the start of one, 0. You can also move between sentences by typing ) (forward) or ( (backwards). For paragraphs, use } and {. Since you are doing everything with your keyboard, rather than having to hold your arrow key down to move around a document, this lets you zip quickly back and forth.

**Other commands**:
cp is copy. mv is move.
The ./ command refers to the current directory you’re in. This is a really valuable command. *helps you find your place!*
 Some of our other favourites are du, which is a way to find out how much memory is being used (du -h makes it human readable — as with other commands). For those of you on OS X, top provides an overview of what processes are running and touch FILENAME can create a basic text file 
 cat *	cat is a versatile command. It will read a file to you if you substitute a file for * , but can also be used to combine files.

## Markdown Tutorial
- Stackedit is a useful place to practice doing MD. I'm already pretty good at it tho. 
-  Since Markdown does not distinguish between fonts, we represent code by wrapping snippets in back-tick characters like "`"` For example, `<br />`. 
- Images can be referenced using !, followed by some alt-text in square brackets, followed by the image URL and an optional title. These will not be displayed in your plain text document, but would be embedded into a rendered HTML page.

Tables/that kinda thing:

| Heading 1 | Heading 2 | Heading 3 |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Row 1, column 1 | Row 1, column 2 | Row 1, column 3|
| Row 2, column 1 | Row 2, column 2 | Row 2, column 3|
| Row 3, column 1 | Row 3, column 2 | Row 3, column 3|


## Pandoc Tutorial

- Installing Pandoc itself proves to be a damn nightmare. Finalement, I manage it!
- OMG MY TEXT EDIT WASNT NATURALLY IN PLAIN TEXT SO THAT SET ME BACK. Ok this is a nightmare, nothing is working. 
I'm going to try and come back to this. [PandocMarkdownTips/Tutorial](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown)

## Version Control Tutorial:
- Ok this makes sense to me: I already essentially do this on github with a lot of my own notes.
- I hate all of this. My head hurts a lot.
- So far can't figure out if github desktop is supposed to allow me to do local changes, as I am only managing the remote ones and then pushing them to desktop. *sigh*

Ok finally managed to get the blog up and running but still not able to get the whole pandoc stuff figured out. Going to stick with what I know for now.
