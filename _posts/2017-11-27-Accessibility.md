## Reading: *Accessibility Whack-a-mole*:

### Conflicts of Accessibility:

- Sometimes when you try and solve one accessibility problem, you create others: IE: for dyslexics, low contrast between text and background are helpful, but this will be a problem for those who are visually impaired. 
- With every change we make, we need to continually check that it doesn’t impair someone else’s experience.

### Fonts: 
- "And it’s not just dyslexia that is sensitive to typography; we recently had a usability testing participant who explained that some people on the autism spectrum struggle with certain fonts, too. And therein lies the problem: there’s a great deal of diversity within neurodiversity. What works for me doesn’t work for everyone with dyslexia; not everyone on the autism spectrum gives a flip about fonts, but some really do."
-  The most practical (and universal) approach would be to build a standards-compliant site that would allow users to override styles with their own preferred fonts and/or colors. And indeed, users should always be able to override styles. But although customization is great if you know what works for you, in my experience (as someone who was diagnosed with dyslexia quite late), I didn’t always know why something was hard, let alone what might help. I wanted to see if there was more we could do for our users.
- Modifying fonts to make the characters look more distinct: change openings, angles of glyphs so they don't touch/run together. 

### Selecting a Typeface:
- Look closely and critically.
- To serif or not? sans serifs tend to be easier to read!
- Use **bold** for emphasis instead of *italics* : this is also easier to distinguish/doesn't slow reading speed. 
- Underline with care: good for links, but can interfere with some functions/descenders. 

- Think about **Space**:
- Comfortable line lengths, generous line heights, sensible line spacing. 

### Words:
- Don't use jargon, try and use clear and conscise language. 

### Nothing is ever perfect/fixed:
- Build with web standards. Ensure that whatever adaptive technologies or techniques people use will work with your site.
- Think twice about icon fonts. All of your icons will disappear if someone overrides your site’s fonts.
- Show people how to override font styles. Would your users benefit from a how-to like the BBC’s?

## Reading: *I Am Not Broken: The Language of Disability*:
- Ableism is that belief that everyone who is able-bodied is “normal” and everyone else is abnormal. Abelism is probably one of the most common kinds of –ism’s, and it rarely gets talked about.
- We are not broken; we’re just a different kind of normal. We are not incapable or unable; we just get things done a little differently.
- Reading helps us become more empathic, more tuned in to those around us. I want my daughter to love literature, regardless of what genre(s) she ends up enjoying, but I want her to learn from it. Ableism is history. We deserve the books we read to reflect this. We owe it to ourselves, to our society, and to our progeny. We owe it to this progressive, fantastic genre. The way we think and talk about disabilities needs to change. Period.
- We are not broken. We are not bent.
- We are powerful, capable, beautiful people. We are important. We are normal. Our normal might be a little different than yours, but it is still normal. We’re no better or worse, more capable or incapable than anyone else. Just different, and shouldn’t we celebrate that?

## Reading: *Disability, Universal Design, and the Digital Humanities*: 
- It is imperative that digital humanities work take into account the important insights of disability studies in the humanities, an interdisciplinary field that considers disability “not so much a property of bodies as a product of cultural rules about what bodies should be or do,” in the words of Rosemarie Garland-Thomson, a prominent figure in the field. 
- We classify some software and hardware tools as “assistive technology”—sometimes the term “adaptive technology” is used instead—because they have been designed specifically to assist those people with “special needs.” We might consider, however, that there is no “natural” way to interact with the 1’s and 0’s that make up the data we are interested in creating, transmitting, receiving, and using; there is only the model we have chosen to think of as natural. All technology is assistive, in the end.

### Universal Design Defined:
- the term “describe[s] the concept of designing all products and the built environment to be aesthetic and usable to the greatest extent possible by everyone, regardless of their age, ability, or status in life” (“Ronald L. Mace”).
- Is there a difference between universal design and accessibility principles?
-  To embrace accessibility is to focus design efforts on people who are disabled, ensuring that all barriers have been removed. To embrace universal design, by contrast, is to focus “not specifically on people with disabilities, but all people”. 
- universal design is efficient
- applying universal design principles to digital resources will make those resources more likely to be compatible with multiple devices.

### Reciprocal benefits:
- by working to meet the needs of disabled people—and by working with disabled people through usability testing—the digital humanities community will also benefit significantly as it rethinks its assumptions about how digital devices could and should work with and for people
- To continue to create projects designed primarily for the screen-keyboard-mouse environment would be foolish: if a resource doesn’t work on a device that lacks one of those components, then that resource is already worthless to a significant number of computer users, disabled and nondisabled alike. As we observe contemporary computing devices proliferate and diversify, we need to plan for a future in which our current digital resources continue to be not only useful but usable.

## Reading: *Access*: 
- “about 15% of the world’s population lives with some form of disability,”.
- . Accessibility exists when a user (who may or may not have a particular disability) can easily make use of a particular digital resource (which may be textual, auditory, visual, or some combination) with their choice of technology (which may or may not be explicitly labeled “assistive” technology) and can, as a result, cognitively process the information as it comes to them from that resource through that technology.
-  primarily visual information needs to be adequately described with textual information – written, or aural, or both – in order to make it usable by those who are blind or have low vision. 
- Reading is full of other readings/resources to look at to think about accessibility. 

## Reading: *Shared Web Experiences: Barriers Common to Mobile Device Users and People with Disabilities*:
- People with disabilities using computers have similar interaction limitations as people without disabilities who are using mobile devices. Both experience similar barriers when interacting with websites and web applications.
- The barriers on this page are grouped under four principles: perceivable, operable, understandable and robust.

### - Perceivable :
Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.
-Information conveyed solely with color
-Large pages or large images
-Multimedia with no captions
-Audio-only prompts (beeps) for important information (warnings, errors)
-Non-text objects (images, sound, video) with no text alternative
-Text entry
-Content formatted using tables or CSS, and reading order not correct when linearized (for example when CSS or tables not rendered)
-Information conveyed only using CSS (visual formatting)

### Operable:
User interface components and navigation must be operable.
-Mouse required for interaction and navigation
-Scripting required to operate content
-Special plugin required
-Missing or inappropriate page title
-Inconsistency between focus (tab) order and logical document content sequence
-Non descriptive link label

#### Understandable
Information and the operation of user interface must be understandable.
-Long words, long and complex sentences, jargon
-Content spawning new windows without warning user
-Blinking, moving, scrolling or auto-updating content

### Robust
Content must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.
-Invalid or unsupported markup
-Scripting required to generate content
