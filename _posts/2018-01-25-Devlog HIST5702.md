## Command Line Tutorial
- Working on the command line. Going well. Finding it hard to decipher what everything means and tend to get confused as to the difference between "shell" and "directory". 
- When navigating through files, important to remember to use cd -- to start over if you get lost, and to think of files as "trees"
- you can basically do anything on your computer without leaving the command line! **Neat!**
- you can also use the arrows to move through the "history" of your commands.

**Using VIM (txt editor)**:

Ctrl+F (that is, holding down your ‘control key’ and pressing the letter F) will move you down a page

Ctrl+B will move you up a page.

If you want to rapidly move to the end of a line, you can press: $ and to move to the start of one, 0. You can also move between sentences by typing ) (forward) or ( (backwards). For paragraphs, use } and {. Since you are doing everything with your keyboard, rather than having to hold your arrow key down to move around a document, this lets you zip quickly back and forth.

**Other commands**:
cp is copy. mv is move.
The ./ command refers to the current directory you’re in. This is a really valuable command. *helps you find your place!*
 Some of our other favourites are du, which is a way to find out how much memory is being used (du -h makes it human readable — as with other commands). For those of you on OS X, top provides an overview of what processes are running and touch FILENAME can create a basic text file 
 cat *	cat is a versatile command. It will read a file to you if you substitute a file for * , but can also be used to combine files.

## Markdown Tutorial
- Stackedit is a useful place to practice doing MD. I'm already pretty good at it tho. 
-  Since Markdown does not distinguish between fonts, we represent code by wrapping snippets in back-tick characters like "`"` For example, `<br />`. 
- Images can be referenced using !, followed by some alt-text in square brackets, followed by the image URL and an optional title. These will not be displayed in your plain text document, but would be embedded into a rendered HTML page.
Inserting images:
![Wikipedia logo](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/80/Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg "Wikipedia logo")

Tables/that kinda thing:

| Heading 1 | Heading 2 | Heading 3 |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Row 1, column 1 | Row 1, column 2 | Row 1, column 3|
| Row 2, column 1 | Row 2, column 2 | Row 2, column 3|
| Row 3, column 1 | Row 3, column 2 | Row 3, column 3|


## Pandoc Tutorial

- Installing Pandoc itself proves to be a damn nightmare. Finalement, I manage it!
- OMG MY TEXT EDIT WASNT NATURALLY IN PLAIN TEXT SO THAT SET ME BACK. Ok this is a nightmare, nothing is working. 
I'm going to try and come back to this. [PandocMarkdownTips/Tutorial](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown)

## Version Control Tutorial:
- Ok this makes sense to me: I already essentially do this on github with a lot of my own notes.
- I hate all of this. My head hurts a lot.
- So far can't figure out if github desktop is supposed to allow me to do local changes, as I am only managing the remote ones and then pushing them to desktop. *sigh*

Ok finally managed to get the blog up and running but still not able to get the whole pandoc stuff figured out. Going to stick with what I know for now. 

# Reading: Poetic Terrorism and Art Sabotage

**Poetic Terrorism:**
- So basically do performance art/deviant acts of resistance. 
Public art created for poetic terrorism/*resistance*. 
The reaction must be strong/akin to terror: intense arousal, disgust, surprise. 
- Don’t do PT for other artists, do it for people who will not realize (at least for a few moments) that what you have done is art. Avoid recognizable art- categories, avoid politics, don’t stick around to argue, don’t be sentimental; be ruthless, take risks, vandalize only what must be defaced, do something children will remember all their lives — but don’t be spontaneous unless the PT Muse has possessed you.
Dress up. Leave a false name. Be legendary. The best PT is against the law, but don’t get caught. Art as crime; crime as art.

**Art Sabotage:**
- Art sabotage strives to be perfectly exemplary but at the same time retain an element of opacity — not propaganda but aesthetic shock — apallingly direct yet also subtly angled — action-as-metaphor.
Art Sabotage is the dark side of Poetic Terrorism.
- Galleries turn beauty into a commodity but banks transmute Imagination into feces and debt. Wouldn’t the world gain a degree of beauty with each bank that could be made to trem- ble. . . or fall? But how? Art Sabotage should probably stay away from politics (it’s so boring) — but not from banks.


**Idea of inaction/destruction as creation** Idea of ephemerality. Idea that "public" history can be personal: affect one person at a time. Is this useful?

*Aesthetic Shock*

## Class: 

ARIS: Location based games and stories. 

Ottawa's public history is official/governmental. Think about the power differential? Still operating on a broadcast model. 
ie: idea of renting/giving away land for greenbelt. Confronting people with an idea of their neighbourhood that is different. Projecting cascades of words/text onto a building: explode the narrative. 
Idea of projecting genres of music/events/band names onto these "underground" music scenes. 
Projecting a history of artist interventions?
*Idea of anonymity* What affordances does this bring?
- Projection mapping of MMIW
- Idea of truth decay: use as much gravitas possible to intervene in truth decay?

- Urban church involved in 60s scoop!!!!!! 
- I like the idea of pushing boundaries and engaging in confrontation: make people uncomfortable. Figure out different affordances. 
- **PLAY WITH THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE NORTHERN LIGHTS TEXT** Explode the text, rewrite it. 

We're gonna build something in Aris! [Aris](https://fielddaylab.org/make/aris/)

- You could do a neighbourhood tour?
- Plaques are way points in the story. I WANNA BUILD A STORY FOR SURE!

- Tool to plan out what should happen: Twinery.

- Could do a walking tour of the "gay scene": explore it chronologically/element of having to stay hidden?

- Hidden history of LGBTQ activism/buildings [Gays of Ottawa](http://www.villagelegacy.ca/tours/show/3) 
[Former/Current Gay Bars](http://www.villagelegacy.ca/tours/show/2)

# Devlog #2:

- Thinking about exploding the "official" lightshow narrative and reconstituting it into statistics that represent the "reality" of what Canadian life is like. 
- Thinking of titling it something like "The (Un)Official Canadian Reality".
- Talked to Shawn about using that explodey program thing to explode the narrative and then figure out a way to reshape it into something else. Something like a series of videos to play in sequence, performance like. 
- Forked a-physical-book from **lizzy** and then cloned it onto my Github Desktop. We will see how that works: will investigate tomorrow. 
- Have been looking into the files from a-physical-book: I have managed to play around with the live demo but have to totally figure out where in the files I am to post my own data: I am worried about breaking whatever code/program is hidden there. Will remember to ask about it in class so I can start working on figuring out how to do this series of videos. 

**Feb. 1st** : Installing node.js (apparently this should help me with a-physical-book?)
This package has installed:
	•	Node.js v8.9.4 to /usr/local/bin/node
	•	npm v5.6.0 to /usr/local/bin/npm
Make sure that /usr/local/bin is in your $PATH. **WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?!** I will investigate. 

## Oral Report Prompts:

Oral Report 1: cracks in the system. How has your chosen tech been used in Ottawa? How could it be used? What are its affordances and edges? Where and why do these resonate with the history you wish to tell/explore? What is it that you don't know but need to find out?

- Cracks in the system: how to actually manage to project this where I want IE: parliament hill. 
- How has it been used? Projection mapping is used everywhere in Ottawa (**NB:** Parliament hill!). Would like to be using the same medium/method as the narrative I am "subverting". Using projection mapping to undermine projection mapping. 
- Affordances and edges? Visual: can be visceral and symbolic: IE: literally exploding/deconstructing the official narrative. Edges: Do I want to also incorporate sound? is this more difficult? Should it be just text? Image based? Linear? Jumbled? **Performance aspect** 
- I think it resonates with the history/story I want to tell because it will concretize the effacing of historical narratives. I think that using "light" to shed light on the dark side of Canadian history is also symbolic and meaninful. 
- What do I need to find out? What to include in the narrative? Do I want all the official text first and then the counter narrative? should it be parcelled out? How much text to explode in each chunk? What is most visually effective/gives people enough time to read the text?

## Rewritten Narrative:

*If we would know something of the future, we have only to look at our past.*
*A land of beauty and great wealth in resources and people.*
**Some quote by explorers describing indigenous peoples as savages/emphasis on resource extraction**

*Mutual interest – and the desire for fur, tools, and knowledge – drove the first great collaborations.*
**Quote land treaties: language of ward of the state** 

*French culture flourished all across Canada.*
**Something about French discrimination?**

*In the War of 1812, English and French speaking farmers in Upper and Lower Canada took up arms alongside British regulars. Hundreds of black men, who had fled north to escape slavery, fought the American invasions of the Canadas. Ten thousand First Nations warriors helped seal the victory.*
**First Nations contribution to war as allies not as subjects: what they expected in return**

*Canada has always meant land. It has meant strength, freedom and pride of place under great northern skies.*
**Quote about indigenous tie to land:landed citizenship** 

*A modern nation rooted in collaboration emerged, from sea, to sea, to sea. Canada.*

*There is something in the Canadian spirit which craves a quest.*
*Quests are real and imagined voyages of discovery.*
**Quests for belonging on part of immigrants? (Maybe a quote by Anna Jameson/Catherine Parr Traill)** 

*We tied Canada together with two ribbons of steel.*
**Chinese exploitation in building of railroad** 

*Canadians drove the axis forces back, liberating the people as we went.*
**Japanese internment/displacement** 

*Canada is a proud, modern nation populated by persons from all over the world.
Our achievements inspire a vision of the future worthy of the sacrifices of the past.*
**Statistic of hate crimes in Canada. Residential schools**

*Nellie McClung: I’m a believer in women, in their ability to do things and in their influence and power. Women set the standards for the world, and it is for us, women in Canada, to set the standard high.*
**Statistic about female wages/domestic violence/MMIW**


### Everyone's oral report:
Christina: history of Lebreton Flats. Empty land vs development. NCC appropriation. Projecting paintings to "refill" the land. 

Kira: Unspoken Ottawa. Look at Ottawa institutions such as orphan's homes or homes for the incurables. Blend fiction and history. History of madness. 

Nathalie: projection mapping: often used by institutions of dominance. Restoring old chinatown. 

Dany: Software development in Ottawa. Museum of Science and Tech has little info about games/gaming. 

Jen: Projection mapping ruins. urban exploration. Show gentrification of neighbourhoods. Show what the buildings could be like. **or tree project**

Katherine: something like Zombies Run. Or soundscape (time hopping) through Lansdowne. 

Cassandra: sound? no using words. link between emotion and sound. 

"Thomas Greyson": torn between serious guerilla project or more fun project. light projection around Carleton: tell narratives that are not necessarily "approved" by the university. A canvas tent and project an image of squatter on land (they were forced out to keep building Carleton up and out). Unseceeded Algonquin territory. *banners on campus* fun idea; ARIS murder mystery. 

# Devlog #3

This week: (in class) figure out how to use the a-physical-book, json stuff. Going to finalize transcript for presentation/performance. 

How we are encountering the digital/changing our perspective of public history? Narrative. Developing digital skills. Changing the way in which information is delivered to the public: interest in public facing academia. Interest in Canadian history/identity and narrative. 

**MapMap** I have it downloaded, but when I try to open it apparently it doesn't work. I will investigate the install instructions. When I try to open it there is a "problem" and when I check in the terminal, it says the file or directory does not exist. Turns out I was downloading the wrong files en masse: got it working once I downloaded and unpackaged a billion things. Now to figure out how mapmap works. 

**Tracery Tutorial** json is a little confusing. It seems interesting though, although I am finding I have to look carefully at the syntax/setup of the sentences/what they generate. I like the idea of using it to build simple bots, but the sentences can get really complex and conufsing and I worry that I wouldn't be able to get it to do what I want. 

## Rewritten Narrative:

*If we would know something of the future, we have only to look at our past.*
*A land of beauty and great wealth in resources and people.*

**Some quote by explorers describing indigenous peoples as savages/emphasis on resource extraction**

*Mutual interest – and the desire for fur, tools, and knowledge – drove the first great collaborations.*

**Quote land treaties: language of ward of the state** 

Two Row Wampum:  From the standpoint of the Haudenosaunee, the kaswentha relationship embodies one of interdependence: the two parties to the agreement may share the same space while retaining, as Anishinaabe political theorist Dale Turner has pointed out, their status as “distinct political entities”. Put another way, kaswentha makes manifest the joint decision by two parties to remain independent together.

**Chinese exploitation in building of railroad** 

The difficulty in obtaining an adequate work force in British Columbia led to the controversial importation of thousands of Chinese workers.

*Canadians drove the axis forces back, liberating the people as we went.*

**Japanese internment/displacement** 

Just over 90 per cent of Japanese Canadians — some 21,000 people — were uprooted during the war. The majority were Canadian citizens by birth.

**Statistic of hate crimes in Canada. Residential schools**

Police reported 1,409 hate crimes in Canada in 2016, 47 more than in 2015.The 3% increase in hate crimes was a result of more incidents targeting South Asians and Arabs or West Asians, the Jewish population, and people based on their sexual orientation.

**Statistic about female wages/domestic violence/MMIW**

On average, every six days a woman in Canada is killed by her intimate partner. Aboriginal women in Canada are five times more likely than other women of the same age to die as the result of violence. The majority of victims of spousal violence continue to be females, accounting for 83% of victims.

As of March 31, 2010, there were 582 known cases of missing or murdered Aboriginal women in Canada. [Source](http://www.bwss.org/resources/information-on-abuse/numbers-are-people-too/)
# Devlog 4

This week will be a weird week since I will be missing class: going to keep playing with the text, finding the sources I need and then playing with MapMap.
Also need to ponder where I want to project it so I can maybe start practicing getting the projection mapping right?
Thinking it would be neat to project against somewhere on PH or UC. Maybe DT?

# Thursday January 11th

## Digital Public History:
Use the digital to reach people in a different way and create a piece of public history.
*You don't need permission!* 
Try and confound notions of what digital history could be.
*Can do sound/game/light based projects*

*The world is thick with digital data* :
- IE: Wifi networks on your phone. 

**Historical Friction**:
WE FINALLY GOT TO SEE SHAWNS WIKIPEDIA PROJECT IN ACTION. Cacaphony (digital data) shouting at us and changing the way we interact with space/history. *The space is annotated digitally and makes it more difficult to move through* Experience the physicality of digital data. 
*All of Shawn's notes/slides are on his GITHUB*

## What is Digital History?
- Digital HIstory as it is versus as it could be 
- Core Concepts
- Weekly Flow
- Your Responsibilities, Your Rewards
- Ottawa as a canvas for Guerilla Digital Public History (Projection Mapping, Pirate Boxes, Place-based storytelling).
sketchfab.com: Sketch 3d models 
**LOOK AT PROGRAM HISTORIAN AGAIN** DIGITAL STUFF FOR RESEARCH. 

## Core Concepts:
- Digital history is about making things
- The point of making is about discovery, not justification
- Through making we come to understand the issue deeply, differently. divergently
- making might let us find again the web we lost, the web we have to save.
- the digital world overlays and interwines the physical world
- this engagenement can involve using digital toold, platforms, and data against the ways that the hegemons desire, it is political
- because it is political it involves an element of danger
- the weapons of guerilla history might be truth and beauty bombs.

## The syllabus:
- documenting process/what you think/what you read
- Weekly pattern: collaborative reading with hypothesis, making, breaking and experimenting in class and out. devlog/open notebook on Github.
- Must push. Must document. Must read/ Must make noise. Go against the grain (digital tech requires submission, push back!) Tell histories that are not amenable to middle aged white guys on the internet. 
- Assessment: oral reports (talking about project), 10 devlogs, Project (paradata and the thing itself). 
- [Assessment](https://github.com/shawngraham/5702w-w18/wiki/Assessment)
- [Schedule](https://github.com/shawngraham/5702w-w18/wiki/Schedule)

## Ottawa as Canvas:
- Counter narratives and hidden stories. Where can we interact/intervene in the fabric of the city? Feasible, practical?
- Ideas of empty space; remnants of history (ie: faded signs). History of the Village. 
- What story lies beneath? 
# January 18th
By next week need to be done the Selected Programming Historian Tutorials
https://mapmapteam.github.io

_**Idea for project: location-based soundcape of homophobic/sexual violence in Ottawa's "The village".**_ 

https://mapmapteam.github.io

- idea of secure connections/file sharing
- idea of how these reflect underpinnings/power dynamics of the techs we use. 

*how do we design to reflect feminist digital history leanings/goals?* 

everytime you categorize something you close down a lot of possibilities/interpretations. creating databases can shut thigns down. 
how do you persuade people to connect?:
- have a narrative
- have a participatory element
- password based: make someone fight for access. 
- scavenger hunt
- physical present/item to signal
- rewrite the purpose of the space (what purpose of a space cannot be touched/changed and why?)
- politics of labour: openness of academic knowledge: idea of accessibility/collaboration. 

**We have no budget!!** Work within constraints. 

- How do we design a digital intervention? Do we need the idea first or the framework first?
*Design Thinking*: comes out of business. 
- Brainstorm
- Build stuff
- See if works
- Start over if it doesn't work

**Inspiration --> Ideation --> Implementation (TRIANGLE)** 
Not a sequential process: cyclical, working between having ideas and implementing them. 

- Soundscape
- Ottawa's Chinatown relocation. Map where the Chinatown used to be. 
- Reframing Gay history in Ottawa: pushing it to the forefront. 
- History of Imperial Theatre transforming into Barrymore's and role in counterculture music
- Mess with perception of time/linear time

- try and find soundscape from the past: you can hear what the city would have been like. 

-Recho (location based sound)
- sound of the dead in touristy spots *hidden dead of ottawa*
- tunnels of ottawa. secret buried train. 
- what triggers it? how do they interact with it? incentive?
- ottawa in the 1920s. 

# Reading: Poetic Terrorism and Art Sabotage

**Poetic Terrorism:**
- So basically do performance art/deviant acts of resistance. 
Public art created for poetic terrorism/*resistance*. 
The reaction must be strong/akin to terror: intense arousal, disgust, surprise. 
- Don’t do PT for other artists, do it for people who will not realize (at least for a few moments) that what you have done is art. Avoid recognizable art- categories, avoid politics, don’t stick around to argue, don’t be sentimental; be ruthless, take risks, vandalize only what must be defaced, do something children will remember all their lives — but don’t be spontaneous unless the PT Muse has possessed you.
Dress up. Leave a false name. Be legendary. The best PT is against the law, but don’t get caught. Art as crime; crime as art.

**Art Sabotage:**
- Art sabotage strives to be perfectly exemplary but at the same time retain an element of opacity — not propaganda but aesthetic shock — apallingly direct yet also subtly angled — action-as-metaphor.
Art Sabotage is the dark side of Poetic Terrorism.
- Galleries turn beauty into a commodity but banks transmute Imagination into feces and debt. Wouldn’t the world gain a degree of beauty with each bank that could be made to trem- ble. . . or fall? But how? Art Sabotage should probably stay away from politics (it’s so boring) — but not from banks.


**Idea of inaction/destruction as creation** Idea of ephemerality. Idea that "public" history can be personal: affect one person at a time. Is this useful?

*Aesthetic Shock*

## Class: 

ARIS: Location based games and stories. 

Ottawa's public history is official/governmental. Think about the power differential? Still operating on a broadcast model. 
ie: idea of renting/giving away land for greenbelt. Confronting people with an idea of their neighbourhood that is different. Projecting cascades of words/text onto a building: explode the narrative. 
Idea of projecting genres of music/events/band names onto these "underground" music scenes.
