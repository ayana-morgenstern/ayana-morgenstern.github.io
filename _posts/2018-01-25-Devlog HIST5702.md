## Command Line Tutorial
- Working on the command line. Going well. Finding it hard to decipher what everything means and tend to get confused as to the difference between "shell" and "directory". 
- When navigating through files, important to remember to use cd -- to start over if you get lost, and to think of files as "trees"
- you can basically do anything on your computer without leaving the command line! **Neat!**
- you can also use the arrows to move through the "history" of your commands.

**Using VIM (txt editor)**:

Ctrl+F (that is, holding down your ‘control key’ and pressing the letter F) will move you down a page

Ctrl+B will move you up a page.

If you want to rapidly move to the end of a line, you can press: $ and to move to the start of one, 0. You can also move between sentences by typing ) (forward) or ( (backwards). For paragraphs, use } and {. Since you are doing everything with your keyboard, rather than having to hold your arrow key down to move around a document, this lets you zip quickly back and forth.

**Other commands**:
cp is copy. mv is move.
The ./ command refers to the current directory you’re in. This is a really valuable command. *helps you find your place!*
 Some of our other favourites are du, which is a way to find out how much memory is being used (du -h makes it human readable — as with other commands). For those of you on OS X, top provides an overview of what processes are running and touch FILENAME can create a basic text file 
 cat *	cat is a versatile command. It will read a file to you if you substitute a file for * , but can also be used to combine files.

## Markdown Tutorial
- Stackedit is a useful place to practice doing MD. I'm already pretty good at it tho. 
-  Since Markdown does not distinguish between fonts, we represent code by wrapping snippets in back-tick characters like "`"` For example, `<br />`. 
- Images can be referenced using !, followed by some alt-text in square brackets, followed by the image URL and an optional title. These will not be displayed in your plain text document, but would be embedded into a rendered HTML page.
Inserting images:
![Wikipedia logo](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/8/80/Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg "Wikipedia logo")

Tables/that kinda thing:

| Heading 1 | Heading 2 | Heading 3 |
| --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Row 1, column 1 | Row 1, column 2 | Row 1, column 3|
| Row 2, column 1 | Row 2, column 2 | Row 2, column 3|
| Row 3, column 1 | Row 3, column 2 | Row 3, column 3|


## Pandoc Tutorial

- Installing Pandoc itself proves to be a damn nightmare. Finalement, I manage it!
- OMG MY TEXT EDIT WASNT NATURALLY IN PLAIN TEXT SO THAT SET ME BACK. Ok this is a nightmare, nothing is working. 
I'm going to try and come back to this. [PandocMarkdownTips/Tutorial](https://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown)

## Version Control Tutorial:
- Ok this makes sense to me: I already essentially do this on github with a lot of my own notes.
- I hate all of this. My head hurts a lot.
- So far can't figure out if github desktop is supposed to allow me to do local changes, as I am only managing the remote ones and then pushing them to desktop. *sigh*

Ok finally managed to get the blog up and running but still not able to get the whole pandoc stuff figured out. Going to stick with what I know for now. 

# Reading: Poetic Terrorism and Art Sabotage

**Poetic Terrorism:**
- So basically do performance art/deviant acts of resistance. 
Public art created for poetic terrorism/*resistance*. 
The reaction must be strong/akin to terror: intense arousal, disgust, surprise. 
- Don’t do PT for other artists, do it for people who will not realize (at least for a few moments) that what you have done is art. Avoid recognizable art- categories, avoid politics, don’t stick around to argue, don’t be sentimental; be ruthless, take risks, vandalize only what must be defaced, do something children will remember all their lives — but don’t be spontaneous unless the PT Muse has possessed you.
Dress up. Leave a false name. Be legendary. The best PT is against the law, but don’t get caught. Art as crime; crime as art.

**Art Sabotage:**
- Art sabotage strives to be perfectly exemplary but at the same time retain an element of opacity — not propaganda but aesthetic shock — apallingly direct yet also subtly angled — action-as-metaphor.
Art Sabotage is the dark side of Poetic Terrorism.
- Galleries turn beauty into a commodity but banks transmute Imagination into feces and debt. Wouldn’t the world gain a degree of beauty with each bank that could be made to trem- ble. . . or fall? But how? Art Sabotage should probably stay away from politics (it’s so boring) — but not from banks.


**Idea of inaction/destruction as creation** Idea of ephemerality. Idea that "public" history can be personal: affect one person at a time. Is this useful?

*Aesthetic Shock*

## Class: 

ARIS: Location based games and stories. 

Ottawa's public history is official/governmental. Think about the power differential? Still operating on a broadcast model. 
ie: idea of renting/giving away land for greenbelt. Confronting people with an idea of their neighbourhood that is different. Projecting cascades of words/text onto a building: explode the narrative. 
Idea of projecting genres of music/events/band names onto these "underground" music scenes. 
Projecting a history of artist interventions?
*Idea of anonymity* What affordances does this bring?
- Projection mapping of MMIW
- Idea of truth decay: use as much gravitas possible to intervene in truth decay?

- Urban church involved in 60s scoop!!!!!! 
- I like the idea of pushing boundaries and engaging in confrontation: make people uncomfortable. Figure out different affordances. 
- **PLAY WITH THE TRANSCRIPT OF THE NORTHERN LIGHTS TEXT** Explode the text, rewrite it. 

We're gonna build something in Aris! [Aris](https://fielddaylab.org/make/aris/)

- You could do a neighbourhood tour?
- Plaques are way points in the story. I WANNA BUILD A STORY FOR SURE!

- Tool to plan out what should happen: Twinery.

- Could do a walking tour of the "gay scene": explore it chronologically/element of having to stay hidden?

- Hidden history of LGBTQ activism/buildings [Gays of Ottawa](http://www.villagelegacy.ca/tours/show/3) 
[Former/Current Gay Bars](http://www.villagelegacy.ca/tours/show/2)

# Devlog #2:

- Thinking about exploding the "official" lightshow narrative and reconstituting it into statistics that represent the "reality" of what Canadian life is like. 
- Thinking of titling it something like "The (Un)Official Canadian Reality".
- Talked to Shawn about using that explodey program thing to explode the narrative and then figure out a way to reshape it into something else. Something like a series of videos to play in sequence, performance like. 
- Forked a-physical-book from **lizzy** and then cloned it onto my Github Desktop. We will see how that works: will investigate tomorrow. 
- Have been looking into the files from a-physical-book: I have managed to play around with the live demo but have to totally figure out where in the files I am to post my own data: I am worried about breaking whatever code/program is hidden there. Will remember to ask about it in class so I can start working on figuring out how to do this series of videos. 

**Feb. 1st** : Installing node.js (apparently this should help me with a-physical-book?)
This package has installed:
	•	Node.js v8.9.4 to /usr/local/bin/node
	•	npm v5.6.0 to /usr/local/bin/npm
Make sure that /usr/local/bin is in your $PATH. **WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?!** I will investigate. 

## Oral Report Prompts:

Oral Report 1: cracks in the system. How has your chosen tech been used in Ottawa? How could it be used? What are its affordances and edges? Where and why do these resonate with the history you wish to tell/explore? What is it that you don't know but need to find out?

- Cracks in the system: how to actually manage to project this where I want IE: parliament hill. 
- How has it been used? Projection mapping is used everywhere in Ottawa (**NB:** Parliament hill!). Would like to be using the same medium/method as the narrative I am "subverting". Using projection mapping to undermine projection mapping. 
- Affordances and edges? Visual: can be visceral and symbolic: IE: literally exploding/deconstructing the official narrative. Edges: Do I want to also incorporate sound? is this more difficult? Should it be just text? Image based? Linear? Jumbled? **Performance aspect** 
- I think it resonates with the history/story I want to tell because it will concretize the effacing of historical narratives. I think that using "light" to shed light on the dark side of Canadian history is also symbolic and meaninful. 
- What do I need to find out? What to include in the narrative? Do I want all the official text first and then the counter narrative? should it be parcelled out? How much text to explode in each chunk? What is most visually effective/gives people enough time to read the text?

## Rewritten Narrative:

*If we would know something of the future, we have only to look at our past.*
*A land of beauty and great wealth in resources and people.*
**Some quote by explorers describing indigenous peoples as savages/emphasis on resource extraction**

*Mutual interest – and the desire for fur, tools, and knowledge – drove the first great collaborations.*
**Quote land treaties: language of ward of the state** 

*French culture flourished all across Canada.*
**Something about French discrimination?**

*In the War of 1812, English and French speaking farmers in Upper and Lower Canada took up arms alongside British regulars. Hundreds of black men, who had fled north to escape slavery, fought the American invasions of the Canadas. Ten thousand First Nations warriors helped seal the victory.*
**First Nations contribution to war as allies not as subjects: what they expected in return**

*Canada has always meant land. It has meant strength, freedom and pride of place under great northern skies.*
**Quote about indigenous tie to land:landed citizenship** 

*A modern nation rooted in collaboration emerged, from sea, to sea, to sea. Canada.*

*There is something in the Canadian spirit which craves a quest.*
*Quests are real and imagined voyages of discovery.*
**Quests for belonging on part of immigrants? (Maybe a quote by Anna Jameson/Catherine Parr Traill)** 

*We tied Canada together with two ribbons of steel.*
**Chinese exploitation in building of railroad** 

*Canadians drove the axis forces back, liberating the people as we went.*
**Japanese internment/displacement** 

*Canada is a proud, modern nation populated by persons from all over the world.
Our achievements inspire a vision of the future worthy of the sacrifices of the past.*
**Statistic of hate crimes in Canada. Residential schools**

*Nellie McClung: I’m a believer in women, in their ability to do things and in their influence and power. Women set the standards for the world, and it is for us, women in Canada, to set the standard high.*
**Statistic about female wages/domestic violence/MMIW**


### Everyone's oral report:
Christina: history of Lebreton Flats. Empty land vs development. NCC appropriation. Projecting paintings to "refill" the land. 

Kira: Unspoken Ottawa. Look at Ottawa institutions such as orphan's homes or homes for the incurables. Blend fiction and history. History of madness. 

Nathalie: projection mapping: often used by institutions of dominance. Restoring old chinatown. 

Dany: Software development in Ottawa. Museum of Science and Tech has little info about games/gaming. 

Jen: Projection mapping ruins. urban exploration. Show gentrification of neighbourhoods. Show what the buildings could be like. **or tree project**

Katherine: something like Zombies Run. Or soundscape (time hopping) through Lansdowne. 

Cassandra: sound? no using words. link between emotion and sound. 

"Thomas Greyson": torn between serious guerilla project or more fun project. light projection around Carleton: tell narratives that are not necessarily "approved" by the university. A canvas tent and project an image of squatter on land (they were forced out to keep building Carleton up and out). Unseceeded Algonquin territory. *banners on campus* fun idea; ARIS murder mystery. 

# Devlog #3

This week: (in class) figure out how to use the a-physical-book, json stuff. Going to finalize transcript for presentation/performance. 

How we are encountering the digital/changing our perspective of public history? Narrative. Developing digital skills. Changing the way in which information is delivered to the public: interest in public facing academia. Interest in Canadian history/identity and narrative. 

**MapMap** I have it downloaded, but when I try to open it apparently it doesn't work. I will investigate the install instructions. When I try to open it there is a "problem" and when I check in the terminal, it says the file or directory does not exist. Turns out I was downloading the wrong files en masse: got it working once I downloaded and unpackaged a billion things. Now to figure out how mapmap works. 

**Tracery Tutorial** json is a little confusing. It seems interesting though, although I am finding I have to look carefully at the syntax/setup of the sentences/what they generate. I like the idea of using it to build simple bots, but the sentences can get really complex and conufsing and I worry that I wouldn't be able to get it to do what I want. 

## Rewritten Narrative:

*If we would know something of the future, we have only to look at our past.*
*A land of beauty and great wealth in resources and people.*

**Some quote by explorers describing indigenous peoples as savages/emphasis on resource extraction**

*Mutual interest – and the desire for fur, tools, and knowledge – drove the first great collaborations.*

**Quote land treaties: language of ward of the state** 

Two Row Wampum:  From the standpoint of the Haudenosaunee, the kaswentha relationship embodies one of interdependence: the two parties to the agreement may share the same space while retaining, as Anishinaabe political theorist Dale Turner has pointed out, their status as “distinct political entities”. Put another way, kaswentha makes manifest the joint decision by two parties to remain independent together.

**Chinese exploitation in building of railroad** 

The difficulty in obtaining an adequate work force in British Columbia led to the controversial importation of thousands of Chinese workers.

*Canadians drove the axis forces back, liberating the people as we went.*

**Japanese internment/displacement** 

Just over 90 per cent of Japanese Canadians — some 21,000 people — were uprooted during the war. The majority were Canadian citizens by birth.

**Statistic of hate crimes in Canada. Residential schools**

Police reported 1,409 hate crimes in Canada in 2016, 47 more than in 2015.The 3% increase in hate crimes was a result of more incidents targeting South Asians and Arabs or West Asians, the Jewish population, and people based on their sexual orientation.

**Statistic about female wages/domestic violence/MMIW**

On average, every six days a woman in Canada is killed by her intimate partner. Aboriginal women in Canada are five times more likely than other women of the same age to die as the result of violence. The majority of victims of spousal violence continue to be females, accounting for 83% of victims.

As of March 31, 2010, there were 582 known cases of missing or murdered Aboriginal women in Canada. [Source](http://www.bwss.org/resources/information-on-abuse/numbers-are-people-too/)
# Devlog 4

This week will be a weird week since I will be missing class: going to keep playing with the text, finding the sources I need and then playing with MapMap.
Also need to ponder where I want to project it so I can maybe start practicing getting the projection mapping right?
Thinking it would be neat to project against somewhere on PH or UC. Maybe DT?

# Thursday January 11th

## Digital Public History:
Use the digital to reach people in a different way and create a piece of public history.
*You don't need permission!* 
Try and confound notions of what digital history could be.
*Can do sound/game/light based projects*

*The world is thick with digital data* :
- IE: Wifi networks on your phone. 

**Historical Friction**:
WE FINALLY GOT TO SEE SHAWNS WIKIPEDIA PROJECT IN ACTION. Cacaphony (digital data) shouting at us and changing the way we interact with space/history. *The space is annotated digitally and makes it more difficult to move through* Experience the physicality of digital data. 
*All of Shawn's notes/slides are on his GITHUB*

## What is Digital History?
- Digital HIstory as it is versus as it could be 
- Core Concepts
- Weekly Flow
- Your Responsibilities, Your Rewards
- Ottawa as a canvas for Guerilla Digital Public History (Projection Mapping, Pirate Boxes, Place-based storytelling).
sketchfab.com: Sketch 3d models 
**LOOK AT PROGRAM HISTORIAN AGAIN** DIGITAL STUFF FOR RESEARCH. 

## Core Concepts:
- Digital history is about making things
- The point of making is about discovery, not justification
- Through making we come to understand the issue deeply, differently. divergently
- making might let us find again the web we lost, the web we have to save.
- the digital world overlays and interwines the physical world
- this engagenement can involve using digital toold, platforms, and data against the ways that the hegemons desire, it is political
- because it is political it involves an element of danger
- the weapons of guerilla history might be truth and beauty bombs.

## The syllabus:
- documenting process/what you think/what you read
- Weekly pattern: collaborative reading with hypothesis, making, breaking and experimenting in class and out. devlog/open notebook on Github.
- Must push. Must document. Must read/ Must make noise. Go against the grain (digital tech requires submission, push back!) Tell histories that are not amenable to middle aged white guys on the internet. 
- Assessment: oral reports (talking about project), 10 devlogs, Project (paradata and the thing itself). 
- [Assessment](https://github.com/shawngraham/5702w-w18/wiki/Assessment)
- [Schedule](https://github.com/shawngraham/5702w-w18/wiki/Schedule)

## Ottawa as Canvas:
- Counter narratives and hidden stories. Where can we interact/intervene in the fabric of the city? Feasible, practical?
- Ideas of empty space; remnants of history (ie: faded signs). History of the Village. 
- What story lies beneath? 
# January 18th
By next week need to be done the Selected Programming Historian Tutorials
https://mapmapteam.github.io

_**Idea for project: location-based soundcape of homophobic/sexual violence in Ottawa's "The village".**_ 

https://mapmapteam.github.io

- idea of secure connections/file sharing
- idea of how these reflect underpinnings/power dynamics of the techs we use. 

*how do we design to reflect feminist digital history leanings/goals?* 

everytime you categorize something you close down a lot of possibilities/interpretations. creating databases can shut thigns down. 
how do you persuade people to connect?:
- have a narrative
- have a participatory element
- password based: make someone fight for access. 
- scavenger hunt
- physical present/item to signal
- rewrite the purpose of the space (what purpose of a space cannot be touched/changed and why?)
- politics of labour: openness of academic knowledge: idea of accessibility/collaboration. 

**We have no budget!!** Work within constraints. 

- How do we design a digital intervention? Do we need the idea first or the framework first?
*Design Thinking*: comes out of business. 
- Brainstorm
- Build stuff
- See if works
- Start over if it doesn't work

**Inspiration --> Ideation --> Implementation (TRIANGLE)** 
Not a sequential process: cyclical, working between having ideas and implementing them. 

- Soundscape
- Ottawa's Chinatown relocation. Map where the Chinatown used to be. 
- Reframing Gay history in Ottawa: pushing it to the forefront. 
- History of Imperial Theatre transforming into Barrymore's and role in counterculture music
- Mess with perception of time/linear time

- try and find soundscape from the past: you can hear what the city would have been like. 

-Recho (location based sound)
- sound of the dead in touristy spots *hidden dead of ottawa*
- tunnels of ottawa. secret buried train. 
- what triggers it? how do they interact with it? incentive?
- ottawa in the 1920s. 

# Reading: Poetic Terrorism and Art Sabotage

**Poetic Terrorism:**
- So basically do performance art/deviant acts of resistance. 
Public art created for poetic terrorism/*resistance*. 
The reaction must be strong/akin to terror: intense arousal, disgust, surprise. 
- Don’t do PT for other artists, do it for people who will not realize (at least for a few moments) that what you have done is art. Avoid recognizable art- categories, avoid politics, don’t stick around to argue, don’t be sentimental; be ruthless, take risks, vandalize only what must be defaced, do something children will remember all their lives — but don’t be spontaneous unless the PT Muse has possessed you.
Dress up. Leave a false name. Be legendary. The best PT is against the law, but don’t get caught. Art as crime; crime as art.

**Art Sabotage:**
- Art sabotage strives to be perfectly exemplary but at the same time retain an element of opacity — not propaganda but aesthetic shock — apallingly direct yet also subtly angled — action-as-metaphor.
Art Sabotage is the dark side of Poetic Terrorism.
- Galleries turn beauty into a commodity but banks transmute Imagination into feces and debt. Wouldn’t the world gain a degree of beauty with each bank that could be made to trem- ble. . . or fall? But how? Art Sabotage should probably stay away from politics (it’s so boring) — but not from banks.


**Idea of inaction/destruction as creation** Idea of ephemerality. Idea that "public" history can be personal: affect one person at a time. Is this useful?

*Aesthetic Shock*

## Class: 

ARIS: Location based games and stories. 

Ottawa's public history is official/governmental. Think about the power differential? Still operating on a broadcast model. 
ie: idea of renting/giving away land for greenbelt. Confronting people with an idea of their neighbourhood that is different. Projecting cascades of words/text onto a building: explode the narrative. 
Idea of projecting genres of music/events/band names onto these "underground" music scenes. 
Projecting a history of artist interventions?
*Idea of anonymity* What affordances does this bring?
- Projection mapping of MMIW
- Idea of truth decay: use as much gravitas possible to intervene in truth decay?

- Urban church involved in 60s scoop!!!!!! 
- I like the idea of pushing boundaries and engaging in confrontation: make people uncomfortable. Figure out different affordances.

# Devlog #5:

- I made my paper mock up of my text and what they will transition to: next I will plug the text into the physical-book animation to see which effect works best (I feel that it will be splatter or bullet mostly). 
- Not so much project related, but I am going to be working through some Programming Historian tutorials on Wget and web scraping: seems like it would be useful and may as well log my process here. 

## Automated Downloading with Wget tutorial:
- Handily I think I already have Homebrew installed from some previous work when I was trying to get Python to work I believe. Or something along those lines. 
- It was with Pandoc because I can see that it is causing some problems with brew "links". I have proceeded to attempt to install wget we shall see. 
Then this happened: You can try again using:
  brew link wget
==> Summary
🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/wget/1.19.4_1: 50 files, 3.7MB
Ayanas-MacBook-Pro:~ ayanamorgenstern$ brew link wget
Linking /usr/local/Cellar/wget/1.19.4_1... 
Error: Could not symlink share/man/man1/wget.1
/usr/local/share/man/man1 is not writable.
- Ok! I finally scrolled through the terminal and saw that i had to change the ownership of the file or something and then I was able to link wget. 
- I was able to download the index for active history and am now going to work on downloading more!

Wget operates on the following general basis:
wget [options] [URL]
So let’s learn a few commands now:

-r
Recursive retrieval is the most important part of wget. What this means is that the program begins following links from the website and downloading them too. So for example, the http://activehistory.ca/papers/ has a link to http://activehistory.ca/papers/historypaper-9/, so it will download that too if we use recursive retrieval. However, it will also follow any other links: if there was a link to http://uwo.ca somewhere on that page, it would follow that and download it as well. By default, -r sends wget to a depth of five sites after the first one. 

--no-parent 
(The double-dash indicates the full-text of a command. All commands also have a short version, this could be initiated using -np).
- Finally, if you do want to go outside of a hierarchy, it is best to be specific about how far you want to go. The default is to follow each link and carry on to a limit of five pages away from the first page you provide. However, perhaps you just want to follow one link and stop there? In that case, you could input -l 2, which takes us to a depth of two web-pages. Note this is a lower-case ‘L’, not a number 1.

-l 2
If these commands help direct wget, we also need to add a few more to be nice to servers and to stop any automated countermeasures from thinking the server is under attack! To that end, we have two additional essential commands:

-w 10
It is not polite to ask for too much at once from a web server. There are other people waiting for information, too, and it is thus important to share the load. The command -w 10, then, adds a ten second wait in between server requests. You can shorten this, as ten seconds is quite long. In my own searches, I often use a 2 second wait.
- Another critical comment is to limit the bandwidth you will be using in the download:

--limit-rate=20k

- I think the idea of *cyber etiquette* is super interesting in that there are more "polite" and ethical ways to go about retrieving data and using the web: i had never really considered it. 

wget -r --no-parent -w 2 --limit-rate=20k http://activehistory.ca/papers/ : so this command tells wget to get files from active history papers, using recursive retrieval, with no parent (staying in the hierarchy) with a 2 second wait, and a limit of 20k/s download speed. Neato!
I ran the command and it looks like it's working!
- If you want to mirror an entire website, there is a built-in command to wget.

-m
This command means ‘mirror,’ and is especially useful for backing up an entire website. It introduces the following set of commands: time-stamping, which looks at the date of the site and doesn’t replace it if you already have that version on your system (useful for repeated downloads), as well as infinite recursion (it will go as many layers into the site as necessary). The command for mirroring ActiveHistory.ca would be:

wget -m -w 2 --limit-rate=20k http://activehistory.ca

## Applied Archival Downloading Tutorial

Let’s get started. The first step involves building a script to generate sequential URLs using Python’s ForLoop function. First, you’ll need to identify the beginning URL in the series of documents that you want to download. Because of its smaller size we’re going to use the online war diary for No. 14 Canadian General Hospital as our example. The entire war diary is 80 pages long. The URL for page 1 is http://data2.archives.ca/e/e061/e001518029.jpg and the URL for page 80 is ‘http://data2.archives.ca/e/e061/e001518109.jpg. Note that they are in sequential order. We want to download the .jpeg images for all of the pages in the diary. To do this, we need to design a script to generate all of the URLs for the pages in between (and including) the first and last page of the diary.

Open your preferred text editor (such as Komodo Edit) and enter the code below. Where it says ‘integer 1′ type in ‘8029′, where it says ‘integer 2′, type ‘8110’. The ForLoop will generate a list of numbers between ‘8029’ and ‘8110’, but it will not print the last number in the range (i.e. 8110). To download all 80 pages in the diary you must add one to the top-value of the range because it is at this integer where the ForLoop is told to stop
urls = '';
f=open('urls.txt','w')
for x in range('integer1', 'integer2'):
    urls = 'http://data2.collectionscanada.ca/e/e061/e00151%d.jpg\n' % (x)
    f.write(urls)
f.close

It was going well until I came to the spot where I'm supposed to save it as a .py and run the script? How does one actually do this or am I supposed to just move on to the next step? I'm going to take a break sweet lord. 
- I have decided to use Komodo edit in an attempt to mitigate this problem? This way I am following the tutorial as closely as possible. 
- Still not working, there are some issues when I try to get it to pull the script/file of urls. 

**I gave up on the Programming Historian Tutorials**
However, I found out that you can use Google Chrome Scraper to do a lot of data/web scraping, and that worked just fine for me! Yay!

## Oral Report #2

- give us where you're at 
*I have settled on the text I want to do. It will now be a matter of actually creating the video files and putting them together, once that is done I can start running it through MapMap.*
- what you're doing 
*Projection mapping. I have storyboarded it.*
- what problems you've hit
*I feel like I am being too ambitious with how I've parsed out my text: it is going to mean creating a lot of individual video files and then combining them into one "performance". I feel like I may try and condense my "snippets" so that instead of having nearly 20 I could have closer to 10 to do. I also have to settle on where I want to project it: I feel like campus would be good because of visibility (I think DT would look super cool with all the windows and also its centrality), and also because my access to it would allow me to properly map the video onto a 3D surface with MapMap. I am also worried that the very way in which these video clips will be put together will make for jarring tansitions between the text as opposed to more of a flow. but maybe the jarring aspect would enhance the project/reflect the jarring nature of the project itself? I'm also still trying to figure out how to actually USE a-physical-book. Also, I am worried about the actual process of having to "reverse" half of the clips to make the text "come back together". I am unsure if this is even possible.* 
- what triumphs
*I'm really happy that I've settled on the text I want to do, and that it seems like they will look really cool when ran through the "splatter" or "bullet" text deformer.*
- your thinking on the historicity of all of this
*I feel like it's pretty good in terms of drawing from a variety of sources and giving a more "realistic" portrayal of Canadian/Ottawa history.*
- etc

**Screencast-omatic. Can reverse GIFS too. The best thing is to do each chunk in the live demo and then screenshot the result. Then splice all the GIFS together how they need to be**


# Devlog 6

I'm on a roll I feel! **Screen-cast-omatic** is allowing me to record my screen while I put my **now** larger chunks of text (which I feel more confident about honestly) through a-physical-book and since I got the Pro version I can edit the video, slowing it down, cropping it as needed, and hopefully the current recordings I have created will be able to be read easily (also thinking of looping the video a couple times when I project it (maybe doing like a 20 min installation or something?), because may as well make sure it can be watched through by many people) because I am concerned that my familiarity with it makes me read it really quickly. I have yet to totally figure out how to reverse the ones that need to be reversed, but I figure I will do that once all my recordings are made. I am also thinking of projecting the panels side by side, having some sort of fade between them to make it look more seamless/dynamic.
I have also figured out how to reverse videos in iMovie, and now it is just a matter of positioning and queuing up the clips into mapmap.

I have been playing around on MapMap, and decided which panels on DT I want to project on. 

I have been playing with Twine for Brian's literature and DH course where I plan on creating an interactive story/essay: It is a lot of work and a lot of steps to figure out all the storyboarding and links. But it is very exciting!

I've also been thinking a lot about non-linear narratives and the primacy of the written word in literature and history, and how fun and engaged I am at the prospect of playing with this notion/trying to change a linear-centric notion of narrative. 
# Devlog 7

I am still plugging away at my Twine assignment for Brian's class: so far my non-linear interactive essay on Walden and Walden:A Game is over 11000 words that include 200 entries and over 300 links! This is super exciting and I really like the way in which my essay/interactive component will in a sense mimic the game and the manner in which Thoreau and the game demand a willingness to get lost in nature/the game. 

My project for this weekend is to work on using MapMap with my two screens at home, to get a sense for how it will work. I am also considering plugging my computer into my own projector to see how that works.

## Thoughts on Paradata:
I had a chat with Cristina about what paradata meant: we came to the conclusion that it was the theory/reasoning and methods behind our project and "making". Ok. I have discussed this before, but I feel that the whole notion of exploding the written word and discombobulating the status quo are at the core of my project, and I like the way that it manages to engage with the intersection of history and english disciplines' fascination with the written word/narrative. 
As far as the methods: as I have been documenting I used the live demo of a physical book to explode my chosen texts. Then I used Screencast omatic to record those clips, edit them to slow them down, and then used Imovie to reverse the clips. Next came uploading all those clips as paints into MapMap. I feel that the idea of using projection mapping is also integral to my project, as I like the idea of *shedding light* on the bias of national narratives. 

# Devlog 8

Still have to practice MapMapping stuff on my computer/two screens. Apparently we may not get to actually project our work because of admin stuff and release forms... wah. 
Many questions still about if my computer will be able to process the whole performance in a streamlined/not glitchy manner. 
Status: pretty much done other than doing the actual "performance". 
No need for waivers! Yay!
Going to see if I can embed the video files into my github/blog.

Fabrica: using an old factory as a piece of public art/public history. 
- Imaginary Soundscapes: mashes image recognition with sound samples. 

Things I've learned: 
1. That a lot of digital work is invisible.
2. That the form of your project can reflect the content in really interesting manners
3. That there is a lot of thinking to do about what you want to say and how you want to say it
4. A lot of digital work is trial and error/playing around/experiementing. 
5. Digital work is often waaay more labour intensive than we think!

# Devlog 9 and 10

I feel like I somehow squeezed two weeks into a single devlog, meaning that I somehow still have 2 left to do: for this purpose I am simply going to combine this week's remarks to make up these last 2 logs. Oh well.
I have been thinking about filming the projection and need to organize the performance aspect of it: it will have to be done at dusk I am assuming for maximum visibility, and I'd like to be able to do it sometime in the next week. We shall see. I like the idea of filming it because then if I choose to create a website for permanence I have the option. Realistically, I have the project on my computer and I could do some of my own guerilla projecting if I really want to over the summer: I kind of like the idea of just running around randomly projecting it without warning and then disappearing off into the night. I have also been inspired to look more into sonification and maybe creating some sort of cool soundscape map in my own time. Just things to think about. 

I created a hypertext/interactive essay/Walden thing for a final project in my literature and digital humanities class. Here's the thing if you wanna play/read [Walden:A Hypertext](http://www.philome.la/ayanadhums/walden-a-hypertext)

# *Canada: Shedding Light on the (un)Official Narrative*:
## Paradata

The process of creating the project I have chosen to title Canada: Shedding Light on the (un)Official Narrative has been one of compromise and uncertainty, a process that surely mimics the creation of any narrative that purports to be 'truth'. However, I hope that the serious thought and doubts that this project has birthed is reflected in the final product and the nuanced narrative it attempts to portray. I like to think that I have given much more thought to my narrative and its implications than the Canadian Heritage officials that put together the Northern Lights Sound and Light Show. Although a feat of engineering and visually pleasing, these qualities are clearly used to subdue its role in replicating and normalizing many nationalist narratives that paint Canada as a nation void of precolonial history, and with a settler colonial narrative that is viewed as natural with a dash of utopianism. 
	
From the onset of beginning this 'Guerrilla History' class, I knew that I wanted to tell a narrative that engaged with marginalized communities and experiences. Originally, I wanted to do something involving sound: I felt that this sense was very emotionally salient and would provoke a strong engagement on the part of the viewer/player. I liked the idea of creating some sort of location-based soundscape, possibly with the use of ARIS. However, my first idea of mapping or soundscaping/soundmapping discourses of domestic or gendered violence proved too ambitious and fraught for the scope of this class. Firstly, I would have run into the problem of ethics because the only way to truly create an authentic and non-performative representation of this violence would have been to give victims voices. This would have required clearance, and although a process and project that I am perhaps interested in pursuing in the future, it simply proved impossible this time around. I also was intrigued by mapping out locations of significance to the LGBTQ community in Centretown's 'The Village' neighbourhood. However, the Bank Street BIA has created a webpage through their Village Legacy Project that essentially does this, and although the idea of creating a sort of location-based game that included sound and engaged with this information was interesting, I did not feel that it was particularly subversive or revolutionary enough. I wanted something that I felt provided more emotional involvement. 
	
Based on my own interest in Canadian literature in my academic – and particularly graduate – career, I decided it would be helpful to engage with something I was personally knowledgeable and interested in. My recent research has focused on indigenous citizenship rights, as well as epistemological mismatches and various Canadian writers' attempts to bridge these gaps, and I have also developed an interest in ghosts as spaces of healing and indigenous resurgence. All this to say that I decided that the idea of working with official national narratives to be a good starting point. I also wanted to use my knowledge of notions of indigenous citizenship and the importance of acknowledging trauma to healing – and its interesting connection to ghosts in Canadian literary tradition – to reflect on how the (un)Official narrative could be improved. From ghosts I thought of light and 'shedding light' onto the truth and how this could be used in terms of the form reflecting my desired content.  I also decided to directly engage with some work I had read in my academic career and something that I had experienced in person, such as the Northern Lights show. I thought it would be subversive and powerful to literally deform and deconstruct the official narrative that accompanies the Parliamentary light show and to do it through the same medium – that of projection mapping. 
	
Shawn then suggested that I look into Lisa Daly's a-physical-book repository, which essentially gives text mass and gravity, and manipulates the text based on different effects. After much poring through Daly's repositories I realized that the simplest way to actually apply the desired effect to my text was to simply use her live demo version. Actually modifying the code to create my own PDF did not seem the best way to go about it, especially with the need to have the text actually be a video. Also the code was very intimidating and lengthy since she converted such a massive corpus, and I felt too intimidated to attempt to wade through it and figure out where my data needed to go. From then on, Shawn recommended finding a way to record my laptop screen and splicing them together to create the files needed for my projection mapping project. I paid for the pro version of Screen-cast-omatic which not only allowed me to record the screen as I fed my text through the live demo, it also allowed me to easily edit, crop, and change the speed of the video to suit my needs. However, I had decided that I wanted the 'alternative' narrative to be a 'reconstruction' of the problematic national narrative, which meant I had to figure out how to reverse some of my video clips. I used iMovie to reverse those chosen clips, and then imported the clips as 'paints' into MapMap. By switching the different paints' visibility, I am able to create a sort of performance where the clips just need to  be cycled through. I wanted to project it on Dunton Tower, but weather and the cold made that challenging. I have decided that once the snow on my balcony is melted, I am going to use my own projector to do some impromptu projections of this project, and would like to record those and eventually place the videos on my Github blog. 
	
I debated about creating a website for the project, but I am less worried about documentation and permanence than I am about embracing the ephemeral nature of projection mapping. I like the idea of doing multiple spontaneous projections over the spring and summer months because I feel like this is more subversive and 'guerrilla'. As a project evidently concerned with the truth attached to the written word, I feel that committing the project in its entirety might be counter to the aims of the project itself. However, it is something that I am open to, and I do like that this project is something that can be sustained and also encourage new digital work alongside it. I really loved playing with the permanence of the written word, choosing to deform 'stable' and unchallenged narratives, making them ephemeral, and again using light to represent a new 'truth'. I believe that true national pride does not entail an effacement of what can be perceived as negative; instead, we have to accept that Canada has ghosts, and that until these ghosts are acknowledged, true healing and reconciliation cannot take place. I also wanted to show people unpleasant narratives that they – as well as myself until recently – might not even realize exist. 
	
If anything, this course and project has taught me that digital work is challenging, yet achievable. Because of this, I feel more prepared to tackle some of the more 'ambitious' projects I had had in mind. I am also very excited to pursue further digital work, particularly with the notion of 'guerrilla' history/narratives in mind. I think it would be great to create a location-based game that blends sound and subversive narratives about gendered violence and hate crimes in Canada. I also really like the idea of sonifying coordinates of some kind and creating a sort of sonic map that narrativizes a theme I am interested in. I am also very interested in the idea of creating story-maps and how those can be used to tell narratives and blend hybrid media like maps with images and text.
