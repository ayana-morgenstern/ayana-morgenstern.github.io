# Public Humanities Notes

## Reading: *"The Argument Made By The Absence: On Whiteness, Polychromy, And Diversity In Classics" by Sarah Bond:*

- pol·y·chro·my: the art of painting in several colors, especially as applied to ancient pottery, sculpture, and architecture.

- My main thesis is that despite our knowledge of the prevalence of polychromy on ancient statuary, there is a predominantly neon white display of skin tone in respect to classical statues and sarcophagi. This assemblage of neon whiteness thus creates a false sense of homogeneity across the Mediterranean world.  Moreover the idea that white marble is beauty is not an inherent truth of the universe; it was in part developed by influential art historians during the early modern period in Europe.\
- About fighting inherent whiteness in history and classics studies: antiquity was very diverse and we are responsible for changing our "white" perception of it. 

## Reading: *"Why We Need to Start Seeing the Classical World in Color" by Sarah Bond:*

- To many, the pristine whiteness of marble statues is the expectation and thus the classical ideal. But the equation of white marble with beauty is not an inherent truth of the universe. Where this standard came from and how it continues to influence white supremacist ideas today are often ignored.
**Classification is oppressive: Enlightenment was obsessed with taxonomy but Antiquity was not!**

- “Color in sculpture came to mean barbarism, for they assumed that the lofty ancient Greeks were too sophisticated to color their art,” Painter writes. The ties between barbarism and color, civility and whiteness would endure.

## Reading: *"“Who Do You Think You Are?”: When Marginality Meets Academic Microcelebrity" by Tressie McMillan Cottom:*

- Racism trumps sexism. 
- Neoliberalism has created educational/academic capital. 
- Microcelebrity refers to the affective capital engendered and commodified by various social and new media platforms where identity and brand are merged and measured in likes, shares, follows, comments and so on.
- Marwick calls microcelebrity a negotiation practice that: “[I]nvolves creating a persona, performing intimate connections to create the illusion of closeness, acknowledging an audience and viewing them as fans, and using strategic reveal of information to maintain interest” 
- Places like Twitter have been great for marginalized voices in academia, though they have to contend with this "microcelebrity" and its issues. 
- Academic microcelebrity encourages brand building as opposed to consciousness-raising; brand awareness as opposed to co-creation of knowledge. It creates perverse incentives for impact as opposed to valuing social change.
- Not only are academics developing these microcelebrity practices in the cultivation of brands but also they are doing so using the digital tools from which the microcelebrity concept is derived
- Public writing became a venue for retaining parts of myself that I would not submit to institutional transformation.
-  Put simply, all press is good press for academic microcelebrities if their social locations conform to racist and sexist norms of who should be expert. For black women who do not conform to normative expectations of “expert,” microcelebrity is potentially negative. Race and gender not only shape the direction of causality but the rendering of attention as dichotomous. 
-  Whereas white women tend to report a significant number of rape threats when they write publicly, the overwhelming threat issued in my comment section and inbox are threats to my academic credibility.

# Public Humanities Seminar (Feb. 5th, 2018)

**DO STUFF IN PRESSBOOKS AYANA GODDAMN IT!** AUMI

Public: everyone. General population. Participants. Stake-holder? Multiplicity of public(s). Community. Public institutions (based on context?) No barriers to access/fees. Tax-funded. Accessible. 
Public humanities: engage in discourse: collaborative. Different bases of knowledge. Connect with non-expert users. 
- the work of federal, state, nonprofit and community based cultural organizations. 
- open the humanities to the public
- engage public in conversations/programs on humanities and relevance to current life. 

Digital vs traditional: 

| Digital       | Traditional      |
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| info access   | scarcity | 
| info overload    | barriers to reach audience| 
| credibility questions | authority/reinforces power structures| 


| Challenges | Opportunities |
| -------- |:---------:|
| exposing to criticism/attack | less-public facing(more protected) |
| expectation to be public facing | interaction with public/audience |
| curating "self" | questions of authenticity |
| pressure to publish/inform public of work | being able to disseminate work (especially if marginalized) |
| challenge unpopular ideas | challenge unpopular ideas! |
| remain level-headed | diversity of voices |
| intellectual property and ownership| more accessible| 
| personal attacks and trolls| open dialogue/forum |

### Personal attacks and trolls:
 *How can we mitigate this?*
 
 - Harnessing it as data/thing to study!!!!
 - Disabling comments/forcing people to comment/critique on their own space. 
 - engaging in dialogue with the trolls (how useful is this actually?)
