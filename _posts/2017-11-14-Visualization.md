# Visualization

There are lots of different ways to use visualization: it is important to pick how to represent the data based on what you want your audience to understand from it. Visualization can be misleading.

## Reading: *The Insta-Dead*:

Look at rhetoric surrounding social media posts selling human remains. 

### Methods:

- in the version of the data that we have made available via our supporting data and code repository we have attempted to strip out usernames in the captions themselves, and we have not provided the account usernames in our table of data. We did keep this information for our actual analysis. We do provide the link to the original post and the original photograph. The only other metadata included is the user ID number, the number of likes, and the number of comments.

- We initially employed a variation of a 'snowball' sampling strategy, beginning at known collectors of human remains on Instagram, documented in previous research (Huffer et al. in press) ('natural selections', 'Oddmonton', 'sickeart', '_craniac_') to see what some of the common hashtags employed were. Our initial list of hashtags:

#humanbones
#humanskulls
#oddities
#curiosities
#realbone
#trophyskulls

- Data sample was not always what they were looking for: had to ask a new question to find more directly relevant posts.
- *If we assume that a person new to the community wanting to buy or sell human remains will explicitly use the '#humanskulls' or '#humanbones' hashtag, what will they find on Instagram? What does Instagram look like from that perspective?* 

### Language of the Posts:

- Through filtering the data, they end up with the most common words in this corpus of Instagram posts that are otherwise uncommon in day-to-day English.
ie:

1. skulls 3679
2. oddities 2644
3. oddity 1287
4. macabre 1223
5. curiosities 984
6. taxidermy 775
7. goth 717
8. handpainted 608
9. crafty 585
10. curiosity 505

### *By contrast, without the comparison to the Trillion Word Corpus, the top words are*:

1. skull 11,308
2. the 5931
3. a 4264
4. skulls 3679
5. and 3665
6. of 3582
7. to 3351
8. art 3220
9. in 2913
10. bones 2787

a clear pattern emerges. We can see that this community frames their engagement with human remains as an experience with the 'other' - skulls and human remains are objects valued primarily for their ability to invoke the thrill of owning something taboo. The words 'taxidermy', 'goth', 'handpainted', 'crafty' point to another interesting pattern in this corpus: the reuse of human (and, clearly, animal) remains for 'artistic' reworking, as well as other forms of art inspired by bone motifs.

*Sentiment Analysis*:

- Obvioulsy (to me at least) the words used are more "negative" than "positive". But we're talking about death so duh. 

*Topic Models*: 

- Note the close association of topics clearly connected with buying and selling, and topics related to trophy skulls and other indigenous ethnographic materials. While a post might not necessarily mention a trophy skull being bought and sold, the patterns of discourse are very similar. These materials are not being discussed with respect, but as commodities.
- Indeed, topic 25 seems roughly to be the dividing line between people who are interested in skulls and bones as a motif/inspiration for their art, and for those who wish to possess the dead.

*Social Network Structures*:

- From 22 accounts directly proclaiming to sell human remains, analyzing their followers. 3 groups emerge.

The first group (users 1, 14, 15, 19, 20) is what we might call the specialists, that is, accounts explicitly selling mostly bones. The second (users 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, and 22) are the generalists that seem to have a much wider variety of materials than just bone. Finally we have the enthusiasts (users 8 onwards), that is, users who for the most part enjoy looking at pictures of human remains. The present analysis cannot be pushed any further than this, and the topic as a whole awaits further investigation. We gesture towards it only for the sake of completeness of the present study. 

*Hashtag Stuffing*: 

- Are there patterns of text reuse in this corpus? And if so, what does that signify?
- The patterning of hashtags and the reuse of sequences of tags seems, on this reading, to be a sign of influence between users or a sign of community, a marker of imagined connection between users.

Placing so many hashtags into a post is also a kind of search-engine optimisation technique known as 'hashtag stuffing'. Actually typing so many tags over and over again on a phone or tablet is difficult, and so we are probably also looking at text shortcuts and expansion to make the process easier and more consistent. 

### Photographic Analysis:

- Look at "visual grammar" of the images.

## Reading: *Discovery and Justification are Different: Notes on Science-ing the Humanities*:

- The struggle between science and humanities is really about context: "I think the issue at the heart of this back and forth dialog is about two different contexts. This is about what you can do in the generative context of discovery vs. what you get can do in the context of justifying  a set of claims."
- Some thoughts on justification: Validity is always about the quality of the inferences you draw and your ability to defend against alternative explanations.
- When we separate out the the context of discovery and exploration from the context of justification we end up clarifying the terms of our conversation. There is a huge difference between “here is an interesting way of thinking about this” and “This evidence supports this claim.

## Reading: *Defining Data for Humanists: Text, Artifact, Information or Evidence?*: 

-  Does data, in particular big data, require humanists to adopt a new methodological paradigm? Or, are the kinds of questions humanities scholars traditionally have explored through close reading and hermeneutic interpretation relevant to big data? In this brief essay I suggest some of the ways that humanists already think about and analyze their sources can be employed to understand, explore, and question data.
-  First, as constructed things, data are a species of artifact. Second, as authored objects created for particular audiences, data can be interpreted as texts. Third, as computer-processable information, data can be computed in a whole host of ways to generate novel artifacts and texts which are then open to subsequent interpretation and analysis.
- Data is not in and of itself a kind of evidence but a multifaced object which can be mobilized as evidence in support of an argument.

### Data as Interpretable Text
- Data is created for an audience. Humanists can, and should interpret data as an authored work and the intentions of the author are worth consideration and exploration. At the same time, the audience of data also is relevant

### Data as Processable Information:
- you can process information—numerical or textual—to change your frame of understanding for a particular set of data.
- Importantly, the results of processed information are not necessarily declarative answers for humanists

### Data Can Hold Evidentiary Value:
- . In much the same way that encoding a text is an interpretive act, so are creating, manipulating, transferring, exploring, and otherwise making use of data sets.  Therefore, data is an artifact or a text that can hold the same potential evidentiary value as any other kind of artifact. 
-I contend that data is not a kind of evidence; it is a potential source of information that can hold evidentiary value.

### Final Thoughts:
- Approaching data in this way should feel liberating to humanists.  For us, data and the capabilities of processing data are not so much new methodological paradigms, rather an opportunity for us to bring the skills we have honed in the close reading of texts and artifacts into service for this new species of text and artifact. Literary scholar Franco Moretti already has asked us to pivot, to begin to engage in distant reading. What should reassure us all is that at the end of the day, any attempt at distant reading results in a new artifact that we can also read closely.
