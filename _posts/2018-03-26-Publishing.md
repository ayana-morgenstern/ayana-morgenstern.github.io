# Publishing 

## Planned Obsolescence
-I've read this a bunch in my own studies, and I find it really interesting how this works in terms of scholarship and publishing as opposed to just technology and ideas/intellectual work. 

## Reading: *Create a New Open Textbook* by the BC Open Textbook Project:
### Some noteworthy stuff on Open Textbooks:
Open textbooks are not geographically limited
Open textbooks are open educational resources (OER); they are instructional resources created and shared in ways so that more people have access to them. This is a different model than traditionally copyrighted materials.

There are 5 rules that govern good textbook format:
1. Rule of Frameworks. 
Memory and understanding are promoted by the use of a structure that mimics the structures we all use within our minds to store information.
2. Rule of Meaningful Names.
Everything we know is tagged with an index or a title. These indices are critical to the ability to recall or retrieve the things we know and remember
3. Rule of Manageable Numbers.
When we learn from an outline, an illustration, or an example; most of us are limited in our ability to absorb new material. As we become familiar with part of a subject domain this number expands, but for new material four to six new elements is a reasonable limit
4. Rule of Hierarchy.
Our mental frameworks are hierarchical. Learning is aided by using the student’s ability to couple or link new material with that already mastered. When presenting new domains for hierarchical understanding, the rules for meaningful names and manageable numbers have increased importance and more limited application. A maximum of three levels of hierarchy should be presented at one time.
5. Rule of Repetition.
Most people learn by repetition, and only a few with native genius can achieve mastery without it. 

**Obviously it is also a useful resource when it comes to help with Pressbooks.**

## Reading: *Conclusions: What We Learned from Writing History in the Digital Age (Spring 2012)* by Jack Dougherty, Kristen Nawrotzki, Charlotte Rochez, and Timothy Burke: 

Lots of continuity in academia and historical writing: The best of digitally-inspired scholarship integrates technology into the art of composing works that feature what many consider the finest qualities in our field: a compelling narrative that unravels the past, supported by insightful argument and persuasive evidence.

every woman, man, and child (with Internet access) can view source materials and publish their own interpretations, thereby engaging in work that had previously had been the domain of professional historians.3 Despite her own misgivings about the web-driven black Confederate myth, Leslie Madsen-Brooks argues that crowdsourcing creates key opportunities for historians to engage with a public that clearly cares about the meaning of the past, and Amanda Sikarskie also emphasizes the role of “citizen scholars” in the “co-creation of content rather than consumption of content.
“the Internet is not an inherently even playing field; to digitize is not to democratize,” 
the Internet is interrupting the traditional academic practice of filter-then-publish, thereby raising the potential for publish-then-filter
Kathleen Fitzpatrick persuades us that the most challenging barriers to the transformation of scholarly communication are not technological, but instead “social, intellectual, and institutional
 Many contributors emphasize the capacity of digital media to create novel forms of dialogic interaction between publics and scholars, to reroute the circulation of historical expertise and to erode some of the privileged authority that the scholarly guild confers upon itself.
 
 ## Reading: *Opening the Journal: How an Open-Access E-Journal Can Serve Scholarship, the Liberal Arts, and the Community* by Hong-Ming Liang: 
Like any peer-reviewed journal, Middle Ground publishes the latest research and furthers scholarly discourse. The journal has adhered to the important standards of peer review for research articles. We have also developed an active scholarly book review section facilitated by good working relationships with many of the major publishers. Because of the open-access and e-format, our reviews are freely available to readers around the world. But we have also made a concerted effort to involve undergraduates and K-12 students with diverse interests, turning the Middle Ground Journal into an effective tool for broad outreach and advocacy on behalf of the liberal arts.
The Middle Ground Journal has created a variety of ways for undergraduate students to participate in its production, creating a sustainable, lasting, and mutually beneficial relationship with our host college. Undergraduate students interested in peer review and editing shadow editors working on projects. Students have been given opportunities to research book catalogs, recommend books for the journal to review, and follow the process of placement of books with reviewers, editing, and publication of scholarly book reviews. Undergraduates contribute to marketing, social media, and web 2.0 projects-for the journal and for MWWHA and WHA as well. For instance, one of our student volunteers, a marketing and design major, designed a logo that was adopted by the MWWHA-a real boost to his confidence, and a good item for his portfolio. Because of our diverse internships, we have had students from such disciplines as economics, biology, marketing, psychology, and nursing. The journal benefits from the interns' diverse perspectives and skills, and the interns learn something about historical scholarship.
